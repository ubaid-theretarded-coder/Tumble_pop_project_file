This is a project file under which contains a code file name as code.cpp and a data.zip file . It is not fully developed any has bugs espacially in level 2 . If i would find some free time i would update the code :)

In order to run the code you would need to do the following process

1. Download these files 
2. Now extract these files in this format such that the Data folder is placed in the similar folder as that of the code files (as mentioned in the **Format.png**)
3. Now open the **steps to complie** file and follow the steps to install **sfml library**
4. Go to visual studio code and Select **File > Open Folder** and select the whole folder which contains code.cpp and data file e.t.c
5. Run the comands written in Steps To Comple.txt .
